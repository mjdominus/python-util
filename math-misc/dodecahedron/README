Paths on a dodecahedron

https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2577433/paths-on-a-dodecahedron
asks how many paths there are between two opposite vertices?

They want not-necessarily-simple paths, which might be easier than
counting simple paths because
of symmetry even though the numbers are larger.  Maybe try both.
