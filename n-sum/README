QUESTION: Say a set of numbers is GOOD if it contains a d-element subset
          whose sum is a multiple of d.

Let n(d) be the smallest number for which EVERY set of n(d) integers is GOOD.

For d=0,1,2,3 we have n(d)=0,1,3,5.  What is n(4)?

Idea:

1. Enumerate all possible unordered d-sets of {0, ... d-1}.
   Queue the bad ones and index the good ones.

2. The queue will produce *all* the examples of bad sets.
   While there is an item in the queue:
     Try augmenting the item with each of <0, 1, ..., d-1>.
     Check if the augmented item is good.
     If it's bad, queue it.

3. The big question is how to quickly check if the augmented item is
   good. For now, we can do it just by brute force.
   In the existing program. this is just numset.is_good()
