I want to find words

       pqs
       x
       y

such that:

     p is a word
     pq is a word
     pqs is a word
     xqs is a word
     ys is a word

Don't need to find x and y independently.  Just for each word pqs,
find (pq, x) pairs and record all such.  Then if there are two pqs of
different lengths, we win; dump out all the pairs.

Maybe:

  68 forestalling,fore,forest
   3 demonstrative,demo,demons
   4 parentheses,pare,parent

Better:

** anticipate
   [ ant        -> part       ] participate         
   [ antic      -> diss       ] dissipate           

** pertains
   [ per        -> bloods     ] bloodstains         
   [ per        -> chief      ] chieftains          
   [ per        -> enter      ] entertains          
   [ per        -> main       ] maintains           
   [ per        -> plan       ] plantains           
   [ pert       -> curt       ] curtains            
   [ pert       -> fount      ] fountains           
   [ pert       -> mount      ] mountains           
   [ pert       -> plant      ] plantains
