I want to find a long (English) word W which has a prefix P which is
also an English word, and when P is replaced by some other string (not
necessarily a word) we get a different word.

And I want this to be possible for the same W in at least two ways.

And I want the results to be interesting or amusing in some way.

Status: only partway there
