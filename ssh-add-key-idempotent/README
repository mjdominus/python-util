Replacement for

	until ssh-add -l | grep -s $KEY_ID ; do
	  ssh-add $KEY_FILE
	done

that I keep doing in scripts

This needs an improvement.  Suppose file A contains key A' and file B
contains key B'.  Then we can load these with

         ssh-add-key-idempotent A' A
         ssh-add-key-idempotent B' B

Fine.  But if both files have the same passphrase, we have to type the
passphrase twice; just using `ssh-add A B` would reuse the passphrase
if possible.

So we should extend the command to take multiple ID-file pairs:

         ssh-add-key-idempotent A' A B' B

This should first determine which subset of {A', B'} needs to be
loaded, and then instead of calling `ssh-add` repeatedly, once for
each file, it should call `ssh-add` once on the entire subset of
files.
