o Distinguish between ints and floats.
  Right now it seems to compute everything in floats.

o Add named functions like sin() and int()

o Stream mode:  eval 'x*2 + y' is a filter that turns a two-column
  stdin into a one-column stdout.  Variable names are assigned to columns
  in alphabetical order; eval 'c1*2 + c2' is equivalent.
