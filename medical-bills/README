A billing DB has the following columns:

Supplied by ABC:

    Claim number (opaque string)
    Date of service
    Patient ID (string)
    Type
    Doctor/Facility
    Total charges
    Member responsibility
    Status
    (EOB form) (do not import, useless)

I should add:

    Status   (None, paid)
    Date paid
    Check number
    Check amount
